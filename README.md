## Learning Philosophy

### The "Two Instruments" Approach
This bootcamp teaches JavaScript and Python side-by-side from day one. Like a professional musician who can play multiple instruments, professional developers understand programming concepts - not just one language's syntax.

### Key Principles
- 🎯 **Concepts first, syntax second**
- 🔄 **Compare and contrast constantly**
- 🤝 **Collaborative learning**
- 🛠️ **Practical, real-world projects**
- 📈 **Progressive skill building**
- 🧪 **Test-driven development**

---

## Weekly Format

Each week follows a structured format:
- **Daily Standups**: Morning and afternoon check-ins
- **Lectures**: Concept introduction and demonstrations
- **Hands-on Practice**: Guided exercises
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborative problem-solving
- **Projects**: Real-world applications
- **Reflections**: Learning consolidation
