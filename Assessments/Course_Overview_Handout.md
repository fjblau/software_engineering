## Our Teaching Approach

### Learn by Doing
Every concept is immediately applied. You'll write code from day one and build real projects throughout.

### Two Languages, One Mindset
Learning JavaScript and Python together teaches you to think like a programmer, not just memorize syntax.

### Professional from Day One
Git commits, code reviews, documentation, and team practices are part of every week—not an afterthought.

### Collaboration Over Competition
Pair programming, peer feedback, and team projects prepare you for real work environments.

---

## The Capstone Project

In the final weeks, you'll build a complete application that demonstrates everything you've learned:

- Full-stack architecture (frontend + backend)
- Multiple programming languages (JavaScript AND Python)
- Multiple databases
- Testing and documentation
- Deployed to production
- Professional Git workflow

**Example Projects:**
- Task management platform
- E-learning system
- Social media analytics dashboard
- Event management application
- Recipe sharing community

This becomes a centerpiece of your portfolio for job applications.
