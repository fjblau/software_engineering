# Instructor Interview Guide
## Software Engineering Bootcamp Candidate Assessment

---

## Session Overview

**Purpose:** Assess candidate fit for the bootcamp based on motivation, commitment capacity, problem-solving approach, and learning mindset—NOT technical knowledge.

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes for interview portion

**Key Principle:** We're selecting for potential, not existing ability.

---

## Before the Interview

### Review the Candidate's Assessment
- Note any areas where they showed strength
- Note any "I don't know" answers (these are fine and expected)
- Look at their self-assessment summary
- Read their open-ended responses carefully

### Prepare the Environment
- Quiet, comfortable space
- Water available
- Assessment materials ready
- Note-taking method ready

---

## Interview Structure

### 1. Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

Start with easy, low-pressure questions to help them relax.

> "Thanks for completing the assessment. Before we dive in, tell me a bit about yourself—what do you do currently and what's a typical day like for you?"

> "How did you hear about this program?"

---

### 2. Motivation & Goals (5-7 minutes)

**Opening Question:**
> "What made you decide to explore software engineering as a path?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What specifically interests you about building software?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years if this goes well?"
- "Have you tried learning to code before? What happened?"

**What to listen for:**
- ✅ Genuine curiosity about technology
- ✅ Clear (even if evolving) goals
- ✅ Realistic expectations about the journey
- ⚠️ Vague answers like "I heard developers make good money" (probe deeper)
- ⚠️ Unrealistic expectations ("I'll be a senior developer in 6 months")

---

### 3. Commitment & Logistics (5-7 minutes)

**Time Commitment:**
> "This is an intensive program—about 30 hours per week in class, plus 5-10 hours of homework. Walk me through how you'd make that work with your current situation."

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What might get in the way? How would you handle that?"
- "Do you have support from family/employer for this commitment?"
- "What would you need to give up or adjust to make this work?"

**Financial/Practical:**
> "Have you thought through the practical side—finances, transportation, equipment?"

**What to listen for:**
- ✅ Realistic assessment of their situation
- ✅ Concrete plans for managing time
- ✅ Awareness of potential obstacles
- ⚠️ Overconfidence ("It'll be fine, no problem")
- ⚠️ Major unresolved conflicts (full-time job with no flexibility, etc.)

---

### 4. Problem-Solving & Resilience (5-7 minutes)

**Past Experience:**
> "Tell me about a time you had to learn something challenging—doesn't have to be technical. How did you approach it?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "Did you ever feel like giving up? What kept you going?"
- "What would you do differently if you had to do it again?"

**Handling Difficulty:**
> "Programming involves a lot of debugging—spending hours stuck on a problem. How do you typically react when something isn't working and you don't know why?"

**What to listen for:**
- ✅ Persistence through difficulty
- ✅ Willingness to ask for help
- ✅ Ability to break problems into smaller pieces
- ✅ Growth mindset language ("I learned...", "Next time I'd...")
- ⚠️ Fixed mindset ("I'm just not good at X")
- ⚠️ Avoidance patterns ("I usually just move on to something else")

---

### 5. Collaboration & Feedback (3-5 minutes)

**Teamwork:**
> "This course involves a lot of pair programming and peer code review. How do you feel about having someone else look at your work and give you feedback?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Tell me about a time you worked closely with someone on a project."
- "How do you handle disagreements about how to do something?"

**What to listen for:**
- ✅ Openness to feedback
- ✅ Respect for different perspectives
- ✅ Experience collaborating (in any context)
- ⚠️ Strong preference for working alone
- ⚠️ Difficulty receiving constructive criticism

---

### 6. Assessment Review (3-5 minutes)

Reference their written assessment:

> "I noticed on the assessment you mentioned [specific answer]. Can you tell me more about that?"

**Possible prompts based on their answers:**

- **If they had some coding experience:**
  > "You mentioned you've tried [language/tutorial]. What did you build? What did you enjoy or struggle with?"

- **If complete beginner:**
  > "You're coming in with fresh eyes, which can actually be an advantage. What aspects of learning to code feel exciting to you? What feels intimidating?"

- **If they expressed concerns (Q28):**
  > "You mentioned being concerned about [X]. Let's talk about that—what would help?"

---

### 7. Their Questions (5-10 minutes)

> "What questions do you have for me about the program, the experience, or anything else?"

**Be prepared to discuss:**
- Daily/weekly schedule details
- Support resources available
- What happens if they struggle
- Career outcomes and job search support
- Specific technologies or projects
- Class size and teaching approach

## Evaluation Criteria

### Score each area 1-5:

| Criteria | 1 (Concern) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Strong) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
