-- ========================================

-- ========================================
-- SECTION 1: [Concept Name]
-- ========================================
-- Explanation: [What you're about to learn and why it matters]
-- Real-world use: [When you'd use this in practice]

-- Example 1.1: [Specific scenario/name]
-- What this does: [Plain language explanation]
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition = true
ORDER BY column1;

-- Example 1.2: [Variation or related approach]
-- What this does: [Plain language explanation]
-- Notice: [Key difference or important note]
SELECT column1, COUNT(*) as count
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;

-- ========================================
-- SECTION 2: [Next Concept Name]
-- ========================================
-- Explanation: [What you're about to learn]
-- When to use: [Practical context]

-- Example 2.1: [Specific scenario]
-- What this does: [Plain language explanation]
SELECT * 
FROM table_name_1
INNER JOIN table_name_2 
  ON table_name_1.id = table_name_2.foreign_id
WHERE table_name_1.status = 'active';

-- Example 2.2: [Variation]
-- Notice the difference: [Key comparison point]
SELECT * 
FROM table_name_1
LEFT JOIN table_name_2 
  ON table_name_1.id = table_name_2.foreign_id;

## Template 5: EXERCISE FILE (STARTER CODE)

```sql
-- ========================================
-- [Topic] Exercise
-- Course: [Course Name]
-- Day [X]
-- ========================================
-- Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard
-- Time estimate: [X] minutes
-- Learning objectives:
--   - [Objective 1]
--   - [Objective 2]
-- ========================================

-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- [Clear step-by-step what the student should do]
-- 
-- For example:
-- Write a query that returns all customers from the 'customers' table
-- where the country is 'USA', ordered by last_name.
-- 
-- Expected output columns: customer_id, first_name, last_name, country
-- Expected output rows: [Number] rows

-- HINTS (uncomment if needed):
-- -- Hint 1: Use the WHERE clause to filter by country
-- -- Hint 2: Use ORDER BY to sort by last_name

-- Your code here:
-- [Leave space for student to write]


-- WHEN YOU'RE DONE:
-- 1. Run your query to make sure it executes without errors
-- 2. Count the number of rows returned - does it match expected?
-- 3. Check that columns match the expected output
-- 4. Compare your solution with solutions/[exercise_name]_solution.sql
```

## Template 6: SOLUTION FILE

```sql
-- ========================================
-- [Topic] Exercise - SOLUTION
-- Course: [Course Name]
-- Day [X]
-- ========================================

-- SOLUTION APPROACH:
-- This solution uses [approach] because [reason it's good]
-- Alternative approach: [Alternative if applicable]

-- COMPLETE SOLUTION:
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
ORDER BY last_name;

-- ========================================
-- EXPLANATION
-- ========================================
-- SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, country
--   ^ We select exactly the columns we need
--
-- FROM customers
--   ^ We query the customers table
--
-- WHERE country = 'USA'
--   ^ Filter to only rows where country equals 'USA'
--   ^ Notice: We use '=' not '=='
--
-- ORDER BY last_name
--   ^ Sort results alphabetically by last_name
--   ^ Default is ascending (A to Z)

-- ========================================
-- COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-- ========================================
-- ❌ Using == instead of = in WHERE clause
-- ❌ Forgetting the WHERE clause (returns all countries)
-- ❌ Using COUNTRY instead of country (PostgreSQL is case-insensitive for most operations but case-sensitive for quoted identifiers)
-- ✓ Correctly uses = for comparison
-- ✓ Correctly filters data
-- ✓ Correctly sorts by last_name

-- ========================================
-- VARIATIONS / EXTENSIONS
-- ========================================
-- Try these to practice:
--
-- 1. Modify to also show order count:
--    (Hint: Use COUNT in a JOIN or GROUP BY)
--
-- 2. Modify to show multiple countries:
--    WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico')
--
-- 3. Modify to show customers from USA OR Germany:
--    WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'Germany'
```
