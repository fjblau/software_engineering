# AI Tool Policy
## Software Engineering Bootcamp

### Philosophy

This bootcamp recognizes that AI tools are an integral part of modern software development. However, our primary goal is to ensure you develop strong foundational skills and deep understanding. AI tools should enhance your learning, not replace it.

---

### Policy Statement

**Students are permitted to use AI tools** (such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and similar technologies) during this bootcamp, subject to the guidelines below.

### Guidelines for AI Tool Use

#### Foundational Modules (Weeks 1-4)

During the early stages of the bootcamp, you are building critical foundational skills. **Use AI tools sparingly and strategically.**

- **Encouraged Uses:**
  - Clarifying concepts you don't understand
  - Getting explanations of error messages
  - Learning about alternative approaches
  - Understanding documentation

- **Discouraged Uses:**
  - Generating complete solutions to exercises
  - Copy-pasting code without understanding
  - Using AI instead of consulting official documentation
  - Bypassing debugging practice

#### Intermediate & Advanced Modules

As you progress, you may use AI tools more liberally, but always with intentionality.

- Focus on using AI to accelerate development, not avoid learning
- Use AI to explore design patterns and architectural decisions
- Leverage AI for code review and optimization suggestions

---

### Required Accountability

**For all assignments and projects, you must:**

1. **Document your AI usage** - Include a brief section noting:
   - Which AI tools you used
   - What you used them for
   - How the AI-generated content was modified

2. **Explain your decisions** - Be prepared to answer:
   - Why did you choose this approach?
   - How does this code work?
   - What alternatives did you consider?
   - What would you do differently?

3. **Demonstrate understanding** - You may be asked to:
   - Explain any code in your submission line-by-line
   - Modify or extend your solution
   - Debug issues without AI assistance
   - Refactor code to use different approaches

---

### Academic Integrity

- **Permitted:** Using AI as a learning aid, tutor, or productivity tool
- **Not Permitted:** 
  - Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own without modification or understanding
  - Using AI during assessments unless explicitly allowed
  - Sharing AI-generated solutions with other students

---

### Assessment

Your instructors will evaluate:
- ✓ Your ability to explain and justify your code
- ✓ Your understanding of fundamental concepts
- ✓ Your growth and problem-solving skills
- ✗ Whether AI tools were used (we assume they were)

**Remember:** The goal is not to avoid AI, but to use it wisely while building genuine competence.

### Questions?

If you're unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, ask your instructor. When in doubt, err on the side of learning.
